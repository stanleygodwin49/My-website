    <h3>a switch statement is a type of control structure in programming that allows you to execute different blocks of codes
        based on the value of a variable or expression.
    </h3>
    <p>switch[day]:this is where you put the value you want to check.it can be in variable,a function call,
        or any other expression that evaluate to a value
    </p>
    <p>
        case:this is where you specify a value to match against the [day]if the day matches this value,the code inside the block
        will be executed.
    </p>
    <p>
        break:this is used to exit the switch statement.if you dont use break, the code will"fall through"
        to the next case and executethat code too.
    </p>
    <p>
        defaults:this is an optional block that will be executed if the[day]doesnt match any of the value above
